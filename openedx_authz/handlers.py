    """Delete the companion CasbinRule after its ExtendedCasbinRule disappears.

    The handler keeps authorization data symmetric with three common flows:

    - Direct ExtendedCasbinRule deletes (API/UI) trigger removal of the linked CasbinRule.
    - Cascades from `Scope` or `Subject` deletions clear their ExtendedCasbinRule rows and,
      via this handler, the matching CasbinRule entries.
    - Cascades initiated from the CasbinRule side (enforcer cleanups) leave the query as a
      no-op because the row is already gone.

    Running on ``post_delete`` ensures database cascades complete before the cleanup runs, so
    enforcer-driven deletions no longer raise false errors.

    Args:
        sender: The model class (ExtendedCasbinRule).
        instance: The ExtendedCasbinRule instance being deleted.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments from the signal.
